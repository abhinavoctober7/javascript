You can add properties to Function, Set, and Map — but how those properties behave is different because each type has its own storage mechanism.

Let’s break it down very clearly 👇

✅ 1. Functions can have custom properties (because they are objects)

In JavaScript, functions are objects with executable code, so you can attach properties exactly like you do with objects.

✔ Example:
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

greet.author = "Abhinav";
greet.version = 1.0;

console.log(greet.author);   // Abhinav
console.log(greet.version);  // 1

Why this works?

Because internally, a function is an object:

{
  name: "greet",
  code: function body,
  author: "Abhinav",
  version: 1.0,
  [[Prototype]]: Function.prototype
}


So functions act like normal objects + can be called.




✅ 2. Adding custom properties to a Set

A Set is also an object.

So adding properties works:

const s = new Set();

s.name = "MySet";
s.createdBy = "Abhinav";

console.log(s.name);       // MySet
console.log(s.createdBy);  // Abhinav

✔ But set elements must be added using .add():
s.add(10);
s.add(20);

👀 Important:

Custom properties do NOT affect the internal Set values.

They are simply added to the object wrapper.




✅ 3. Adding custom properties to a Map

Same as Set — Map is also an object.

Example:
const m = new Map();

m.title = "Users Data";
m.description = "Stores user IDs";

console.log(m.title);        // Users Data
console.log(m.description);  // Stores user IDs

✔ But map key-value pairs must be added via .set():
m.set("id", 101);
m.set("name", "Abhinav");

❗ Adding a normal property is not stored inside Map’s internal key-value structure.
🧠 So what’s happening?

All of these: Function, Set, Map Are ultimately objects stored in the heap.

So we can always do:

obj.someCustomProperty = value;


But:

🚫 What is stored inside Set/Map structure

→ must be added using .add() or .set().
✔ What is stored on the object (as meta-data)
→ can be added like any normal property.
