In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens.
This is a core concept in interviews.

Note: Not Just function, all other data types are also first-class citizens in JS.

✅ Simple Definition
If something is a first-class citizen (or first-class object), it means it can be treated like a normal value.
------> You can store it in variables, pass it as arguments, return it from functions, etc.

In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens.
🧠 What can a first-class citizen do?

If a value is first-class, it can:
✔ 1. Be stored in a variable
const greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello");
};

✔ 2. Be passed as an argument
setTimeout(() => console.log("Hi"), 1000);

✔ 3. Be returned from another function
function outer() {
  return function () {
    console.log("Inner");
  };
}

✔ 4. Be stored in arrays or objects
const arr = [() => console.log("A"), () => console.log("B")];

🎯 Simple Interview Definition
Functions are treated as values in JavaScript.
That’s why we can pass them, store them, and return them — meaning they are first-class citizens.

🔥 Why important?
Because of first-class functions, JavaScript supports:
1. Higher-Order Functions (HOFs)
2. Callbacks
3. Closures
4. Functional programming
5. Promises
6. Event listeners

🚀 Very Simple Example
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

function executor(fn) {
  fn(); // calling a function passed as a value
}

executor(sayHello);


Here, sayHello is used like data, proving it is first-class.
