Here is the clearest and simplest explanation of mutable vs immutable in JavaScript 👇

🔵 1. Mutable (Changeable)
Mutable = the value can be changed or modified in place.
Objects in JS are mutable.
Examples:
Object { }, Array [ ], Function, Map, Set, Date, RegExp

✅ You can modify them:
const obj = { name: "Abhinav" };
obj.name = "Kumar";      // changed

const arr = [1, 2];
arr.push(3);             // changed


You are not replacing the entire obj/arr, You are modifying their internal values.

🔴 2. Immutable (Not changeable)
Immutable = the value CANNOT be changed once created.
Primitive values in JS are immutable:
Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt

❗ You cannot modify them — only replace them.

Example with string:
let str = "Hello";
str[0] = "Y";   // ❌ does nothing
console.log(str); // "Hello"


If you “change” a primitive, you're actually creating a new value:

str = "World"; // new string created

🔥 Key Difference
Type	    Mutable?	 Stored Where?	  Example
Primitive	❌ No	    Stack	         "A", 10, true, null
Object	    ✅ Yes	    Heap	         {}, [], new Date()

🧠 Why primitives are immutable?
They are simple fixed-size values.
They are stored in the stack, which prefers immutability for performance.
If strings were mutable, security & performance would break.



🧠 Why objects are mutable?
Objects store dynamic data.
They can grow or shrink.
Stored in heap, which allows flexibility.

🎯 Super Simple Example
Primitive (immutable):
let x = 10;
x = 20;   // replaced, not modified

Object (mutable):
let user = { age: 25 };
user.age = 30;   // modified

📝 In One Line:

Mutable = change inside the same memory
Immutable = create a new value instead of changing
