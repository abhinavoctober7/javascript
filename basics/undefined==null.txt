undefined == null is true because of JavaScript’s loose (==) equality rules.
Let’s break it down in the simplest possible way 👇

✅ 1. == does type coercion
The double-equals (==) operator converts both values to a common type before comparison.

JavaScript has a special rule:
👉 undefined is loosely equal ONLY to null
Nothing else. So this is true: undefined == null  // true


Because JS says:
When comparing undefined and null using ==, treat them as equal.
❌ But this is NOT true with ===
undefined === null  // false


Because strict equality (===) compares:
value AND data type

undefined → type: "undefined"
null → type: "object" (JS quirk)

So they are not strictly equal.

⚙️ Why does JavaScript do this?

Because both represent "no value", but in different ways:
undefined → variable exists but no value assigned (accidental)
null → intentional empty value (developer sets it)

So Brendan Eich (JS creator) made them equal in == to reduce errors in early JS.
