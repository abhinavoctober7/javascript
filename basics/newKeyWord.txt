Here is a line-by-line explanation of your code in a very clear and simple way:
function ConstructorExample(fName, lName) {
  this.firstName = fName;
  this.lName = lName;
  this.printFullName = function () {
    console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.lName);
  };
}

🧩 Line-by-line Explanation
1. function ConstructorExample(fName, lName) {
You are defining a constructor function.
Constructor functions are used to create objects.
fName and lName are parameters (inputs) passed during object creation.

2. this.firstName = fName;
this refers to the new object being created (only when called with new keyword).
This line creates a property called firstName inside the new object.
It stores the value passed as fName.

Example: If you call new ConstructorExample("Alice", "Smith"),
then inside:
this.firstName = "Alice"

3. this.lName = lName;
Creates another property lName inside the object.
Stores the value passed as lName.

Example: this.lName = "Smith"

4. this.printFullName = function () { ... };
You are adding a method (a function inside an object) to the object.
printFullName will be available for every object created with this constructor.

5. Inside that method:
console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.lName);
this inside the method refers to the same object.
It prints firstName + space + lName.
For person1, this becomes "Alice Smith".

🧩 Creating an Object
const person1 = new ConstructorExample("Alice", "Smith");

What does new do? (Very important)
When you write new:
It creates a new empty object: {}
It sets this to point to that new object

It adds the prototype:
newObj.__proto__ = ConstructorExample.prototype

It executes the function body

It automatically returns the new object

So after this line, person1 becomes:

{
  firstName: "Alice",
  lName: "Smith",
  printFullName: function () {
    console.log("Alice Smith");
  }
}

🧩 Calling the method
person1.printFullName(); // Output: Alice Smith


This calls the printFullName method on person1.

this inside the method now refers to person1.

It prints "Alice Smith".

🎯 Final Summary
Line / Concept	Meaning
ConstructorExample()	A special function to create objects
this.firstName	Creates property inside object
this.lName	Another property
this.printFullName	A method added to each created object
new ConstructorExample()	Creates & returns a new object
