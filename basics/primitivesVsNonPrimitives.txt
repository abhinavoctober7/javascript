✅ Why are arrays, functions, dates, regex, maps, sets → all objects?

Because in JavaScript:
👉 Everything that is not a primitive is an object.
👉 Objects are the only complex (non-primitive) data type.

So JS does not have separate memory models for:
1. Arrays
2. Functions
3. Maps
4. Sets
5. Dates
6. Regex
7. Classes
Anything else

All of them are just specialized objects with extra behavior.

🧠 JavaScript Data Types
1. Primitive Types (stored directly on Stack)
number, string, boolean, null, undefined, bigint, symbol

2. Everything else → Objects (stored on Heap)
Array, Function, Object literal, Map, Set, Date, Regex, Error, Promise, Class instance, … and more

⚙️ How JavaScript internally handles them
All complex structures need:

1. dynamic size
2. methods
3. metadata
4. internal properties

This is why JS stores them in the Heap, and only stores a reference in the stack.

📦 Example — Array is an object
const arr = [1, 2, 3];


Internally JS does:

STACK                                 HEAP
---------------------------------     ---------------------
arr → (address) --------------------> { 0:1, 1:2, 2:3, length:3 }
                                      [[Prototype]] → Array.prototype


Array is basically an object with:
numeric keys, a length property, prototype methods (push, pop, …)

🧩 Example — Function is an object
function greet() { console.log("hi"); }

Internally:

STACK                             HEAP
-----------------------------     -------------------------------
greet → address --------------->  { 
                                    code: "function body",
                                    name: "greet",
                                    [[Prototype]]: Function.prototype
                                  } (METADATA)


Functions are objects with executable code attached.

🗓 Date is an object
const today = new Date();

Heap stores:
internal timestamp
prototype methods (getFullYear, toISOString…)


🔍 Regex is an object
const re = /ab+c/;

Heap stores:
pattern
flags
match state

🗺 Map / Set are objects

They are just objects with optimized internal storage engines.

👉 Anything that grows, has methods, or has internal properties = OBJECT = stored in HEAP.
