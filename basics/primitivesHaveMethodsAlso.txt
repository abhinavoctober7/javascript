Great point — numbers and strings look like they have methods, but they do NOT actually store methods or grow in size like objects.

This confuses many people, so let me explain it clearly and simply 👇

✅ Primitives (string, number, boolean) DO NOT have real methods

When you do:
"hello".toUpperCase()
(42).toFixed(2)

it looks like the primitive has methods, but it does NOT.

Instead, JavaScript does a temporary magic trick.
✨ JavaScript temporarily wraps primitives in objects

When you call a method on a primitive:
Example: "hello".toUpperCase()


JavaScript internally does:
1. Convert "hello" (primitive) → String object wrapper
2. Call String.prototype.toUpperCase on the wrapper
3. Destroy the temporary wrapper
4. Return result


So in reality:

"hello" → is primitive  ✔
new String("hello") → temporary wrapper object ✔

📌 This is called “Boxing” or “Primitive Wrapper Objects”

Primitive → Wrapped in object → Method runs → Wrapper thrown away.

These wrapper objects are:

Primitive	Wrapper Object
string	    String
number	    Number
boolean	    Boolean
symbol	    Symbol
bigint	    BigInt
🛑 But primitives themselves do not store methods in memory

"hello" does NOT store toUpperCase
42 does NOT store toFixed
true does NOT store valueOf

All methods actually live on:
String.prototype
Number.prototype
Boolean.prototype


The primitive borrows them temporarily.

This is why primitives are:
stored on stack, simple, fixed-size, cannot grow

🔥 Difference Example
Object string:
const s = new String("hello");
console.log(typeof s); // 'object'

Primitive string:
const s = "hello";
console.log(typeof s); // 'string'


The object version lives in heap.
The primitive version lives in stack.

⭐ So why primitives have “methods”?

Because JS auto-boxes them:
✔ They temporarily borrow methods from their wrapper prototypes.
✔ This trick gives modern-feeling syntax.
✔ But they remain primitive values, NOT objects.

🧠 Final Answer (Interview Friendly)

Primitives like numbers and strings seem to have methods, but they don’t.
JavaScript temporarily wraps them inside an object (String, Number) to provide methods.
The primitive itself never grows, never stores properties, and stays in stack memory.

That’s why:

👉 Primitives = not objects
👉 Arrays, functions, maps, sets = real objects stored in heap
