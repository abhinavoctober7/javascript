In JavaScript, null is one of the primitive data types. It represents:

✅ “Intentional absence of value”
It means you deliberately set something to nothing.
Example: let user = null;  

This means:
✔️ user exists
✔️ but currently has no value
✔️ intentionally empty (not an accident)

🔍 null vs undefined
undefined
➡️ Value is missing accidentally
➡️ Variable declared but never assigned

Example:
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

null
➡️ Value is missing intentionally
➡️ Developer sets it manually

Example:
let b = null;
console.log(b); // null

☑️ Technical Details about null
1. typeof null is "object" (a bug)

This is a famous JavaScript design mistake.
typeof null; // "object"

But null is NOT an object — it’s a primitive.

2. null means: no object

When you do:

let person = null;
You’re saying:

"This should later hold an object, but right now it is empty."

3. Common Uses
- Resetting a variable
- Clearing an object
- Indicating "no data found"

Example:

function findUser() {
  return null; // user not found
}

🧠 Why do we need null if we have undefined?

Because they express different meanings:

Value	    Meaning
undefined	Not assigned / missing accidentally
null	    Empty on purpose / intentional absence

✨ Summary
null is a primitive.
Represents intentional absence of value.
typeof null is "object" (bug).







In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that means:
✅ “A variable exists, but no value has been assigned to it.”
It represents absence of value — but unintentionally.

🔍 When do you get undefined?
1. Variable declared but not assigned
let x;
console.log(x);  // undefined

2. Function without a return statement
function test() {}
console.log(test());  // undefined

3. Accessing a missing object property
let user = {};
console.log(user.name); // undefined

4. Accessing array elements out of range
let arr = [10];
console.log(arr[5]);  // undefined

5. Missing function parameter
function greet(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
greet();    // undefined

🆚 Difference Between undefined and null
Value	     Meaning	                       Who sets it?
undefined	 No value assigned by accident	 JavaScript engine
null	     No value on purpose	           Developer

Example:
let a;      // undefined → JS sets it
let b = null;  // null → we set it deliberately

🔧 Type of undefined
typeof undefined; // "undefined"

❗ Common Misconceptions
❌ "undefined means variable not declared"

Incorrect.

If a variable is not declared, it throws error:
console.log(notDeclared); // ReferenceError

☑️ Summary
undefined means no value assigned.
Set automatically by JavaScript.
Common when reading missing data.
Different from null (intentional empty value).







NaN in JavaScript means Not-a-Number.
But the name is misleading—because NaN itself is a number type, just a special one.
Let me explain very clearly 👇

✅ What is NaN?
NaN is a special numeric value that represents:
A value that is supposed to be a number, but the result is not a valid number.
It occurs when a numeric operation fails.

📌 Examples of NaN
❌ 1. Invalid mathematical operations
0 / 0       // NaN
Math.sqrt(-1) // NaN

❌ 2. Converting non-number strings to numbers
Number("Hello")   // NaN
parseInt("abc")   // NaN

❌ 3. Performing arithmetic with undefined
10 * undefined   // NaN

❌ 4. Subtracting non-numeric values
"abc" - 10   // NaN

🧠 Important Facts About NaN
1️⃣ NaN is of type "number"
typeof NaN   // "number"

2️⃣ NaN is the only value in JS that is NOT equal to itself
NaN == NaN       // false
NaN === NaN      // false


Because it's considered an invalid number, so it can't equal anything—not even itself.

This is why JS has a special checker:

✔ Use Number.isNaN()
Number.isNaN(NaN);        // true
Number.isNaN("Hello");    // false
