✅ In ES5 (old JavaScript)

There were only 5 primitive data types:

1. Number

2. String

3. Boolean

4. Undefined

5. Null

✔ This is what older interview books/notes mention.
✔ Before ES6, only these 5 were considered primitive.

✅ In Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

JavaScript added new primitives, so now there are 7 primitive types:

1. Number

2. String

3. Boolean

4. Undefined

5. Null

6. Symbol (added in ES6)

7. BigInt (added in ES2020)

🔥 So what's correct?
✔ If interviewer means modern JS → 7 primitives
✔ If interviewer means ES5 (old JS) → 5 primitives

Both are correct based on context.

📌 Non-primitive (always 1 type)

Object

Arrays, functions, dates, regex, maps, sets → all objects.
