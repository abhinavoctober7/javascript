🟦 What is Shallow Copy?
A shallow copy copies only the top-level values.

If the object contains nested objects/arrays,
👉 it copies only the reference, NOT the actual nested values.

Example:
const obj = { 
  name: "Abhi",
  address: { city: "Delhi" }
};
const copy = { ...obj }; // shallow copy
copy.address.city = "Mumbai";
console.log(obj.address.city);  // ❗ Output: "Mumbai"
Why?

Because address object is same reference in both obj and copy.

🟩 What is Deep Copy?

A deep copy creates a brand-new, independent copy of the entire object.
All nested objects/arrays are also copied separately.

Example:
const obj = { 
  name: "Abhi",
  address: { city: "Delhi" }
};
const copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)); // deep copy
copy.address.city = "Mumbai";
console.log(obj.address.city);  // ✅ Output: "Delhi"

Why?

Because now address inside copy is a different object in memory.
🔥 Main Difference (1 Line)
Shallow Copy	                    Deep Copy
Copies only top-level	            Copies entire nested structure
Nested values share same reference	Nested values are fully independent
Faster	                            Slower
Not safe for complex objects	    Safe for complex objects
🔧 Ways to Make Shallow Copy

(Only top-level copied)
For Objects:
const copy = Object.assign({}, obj);
const copy = { ...obj };

For Arrays:
const copy = [...arr];
const copy = arr.slice();

🔧 Ways to Make Deep Copy
(Everything copied)
1. JSON method (simple)
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));

❗ Fails with:
functions, undefined, Date, Map/Set

2. Structured Clone (BEST) ✔✔
const deepCopy = structuredClone(obj);

Works for: Dates, Arrays, Objects, Maps, Sets, ❌ Not for functions.

🎯 Final Summary (Super Easy)

✔ Shallow copy → copy only first layer
✔ Deep copy → copy everything

✔ Shallow is faster but dangerous (because shared references)
✔ Deep is safe but slower
