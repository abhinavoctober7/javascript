⚡ Stack vs Heap (Super Simple Explanation)

Think of your program like a restaurant:
Stack = the kitchen counter where orders are placed in strict order.
Heap = the store room where large or flexible items are stored.


🥞 STACK — Fast, Organized, Fixed-size
✔ Very fast
✔ Stores small, fixed-size data
✔ LIFO (Last In, First Out) — like plates stacked
✔ Memory is automatically freed when function ends


What goes to Stack?
Primitive values (numbers, boolean, string reference, etc.)
Function call frames (variables inside functions)
Address pointing to objects in heap

Example
function test() {
  let a = 10;     // primitive → stack
  let b = 20;     // primitive → stack
  
  let obj = { x: 5 }; // obj reference → stack
                      // actual object → heap
}


Visual:
STACK                          HEAP
-------------------          -------------
a = 10                       
b = 20                       
obj → ---------------------> { x: 5 }


When function ends → a, b, and obj pointer are removed.
But the object in heap stays until garbage-collected.



🧳 HEAP — Big, Flexible, Slower
✔ Used for dynamic / big / unknown-size data
✔ No strict order
✔ Memory is manually managed (or GC does it)


What goes to Heap?
Objects
Arrays
Functions
Anything with dynamic size

Example:

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];


arr reference → stack

Actual [1,2,3,4] → heap

🤔 Why not put everything in stack?

Because stack is:
Small (limited size)
Fast but strict order
Can't store big/dynamic data

Heap is:
Large, flexible
Good for objects/arrays/functions
But slower to access
