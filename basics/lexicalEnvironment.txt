✅ Lexical Environment (Simple Definition)

A Lexical Environment is a structure that stores:
1. Local variables (let, const, function arguments)
2. Function declarations
3. A reference to the outer (parent) environment

It is created every time:
1. A function is called
2. A block executes (if, for, { })
3. A script or module starts

📌 Why is it called "Lexical"?
Because the environment is determined by where the code is written (lexically), not where it is executed. JavaScript looks at the physical placement of your code to decide the scope.

🧠 Example to Understand Lexical Environment
let a = 10;
function outer() {
  let b = 20;

  function inner() {
    let c = 30;
    console.log(a, b, c);
  }

  inner();
}
outer();

Environments created:
1️⃣ Global Lexical Environment
a: 10
outer: function
outerEnv: null

2️⃣ outer() Lexical Environment
b: 20
inner: function
outerEnv: global

3️⃣ inner() Lexical Environment
c: 30
outerEnv: outer()


When inner() runs, it searches variables like this:
inner → outer → global


This chain is called the Scope Chain.

🧩 Important Facts
✔ Each function has its own Lexical Environment
Created every time the function is invoked.

✔ Variables are stored in the "Environment Record"
This is part of the Lexical Environment.

✔ The link to the parent is fixed

Because the function “remembers” where it was written → this creates closure.

🎯 One-Line Definition

A Lexical Environment is the internal structure that stores variables and the reference to its outer scope, created based on where code is written.


function outer(){
    let arrFun = [];
    for(var i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        arrFun.push(function fn(){
            console.log(i)
        })
    }
    return arrFun;
}
console.log(outer()[0]());
