What is “this substitution” in JavaScript?
This is a REAL term used in the JavaScript language specification.

Let me explain it very simply.
✅ What is “this substitution”?
When JavaScript is in strict mode, you cannot automatically convert:
undefined → global object, null → global object

So ES5 introduced a concept called This Substitution.
Meaning: When JavaScript evaluates this, it sometimes substitutes the value of this before using it.

📌 In non–strict mode ("sloppy mode")
If you call:
function f() {
  console.log(this);
}
f();
You expect: window  (in browser), global  (in Node)


Why? Because of this substitution.

Rule: If this becomes undefined or null, JavaScript substitutes it with the global object.

So in non–strict mode: undefined → window, null → window


This is “this substitution”.
📌 In strict mode
"use strict";

function f() {
  console.log(this);
}
f();
Output: undefined

Why?
Because strict mode turns off “this substitution”. this remains whatever it originally is (undefined in this case).

📌 Example to see this substitution in action
Non-Strict Mode:
function f() {
  console.log(this);
}
f();  // substitutes undefined with window
Output: window

Strict Mode:
"use strict";
function f() {
  console.log(this);
}
f();  // NO substitution

Output: undefined

📌 This substitution also happens when calling functions on primitives
Example: "hello".toUpperCase();

What is "hello"? A primitive string.

Primitives cannot have methods.

So JavaScript does:

this substitution:
"hello" → new String("hello")   (temporary wrapper)

This allows the method to work.

After finishing, the wrapper is destroyed.

🧠 Short Interview Answer

“This substitution” is a rule in JavaScript where certain values of this (like undefined or null in non-strict mode) are automatically replaced with the global object. In strict mode this substitution does not happen. It also applies when primitives temporarily get wrapped into objects for method calls.

⭐ Super Simple Summary
Case	                        What happens	               Why
Non-strict mode, function call	this = window	               this substitution
Strict mode	                    this = undefined               substitution disabled
Method on primitive	            "abc" becomes String("abc")	   substitution for methods
