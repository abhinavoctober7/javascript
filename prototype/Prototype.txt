✅ 1. What is a Prototype?
A prototype is simply an object from which other objects can inherit methods and properties.

In JavaScript: Every object has a hidden internal property called [[Prototype]].
You can see it in Chrome DevTools as __proto__. This prototype contains shared methods.

✅ 2. How Arrays Get Their Methods?

When you create an array like:

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
JavaScript does NOT attach push, pop, map, filter directly to arr.

Instead:

arr’s prototype is Array.prototype
All methods like push, pop, map, filter are defined once in Array.prototype

Your array inherits these methods
So when you call: arr.push(4);

The JS engine checks: Does arr contain push directly? ❌ No

Then check arr.__proto__ (which is Array.prototype)

Does Array.prototype have push? ✔️ Yes → use it

This is called prototype lookup / prototype chaining.

🔥 Prototype Chain of an Array
arr → Array.prototype → Object.prototype → null
