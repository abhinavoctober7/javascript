Here is the clearest and simplest explanation of var in JavaScript that covers everything interviewers ask 👇

🔥 What is var?
var is the old way to declare variables in JavaScript (before ES6/2015).
var x = 10;

It still works today, but it has problems, which is why we use let and const now.



🧨 Key Features of var (Very Important)
These 4 points are asked in almost every interview 👇

1️⃣ Function Scoped (NOT block-scoped)
var is only limited to functions, not blocks (if, for, {}).

Example:
if (true) {
  var x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // 10 → NOT block-scoped

But inside a function:
function test() {
  var y = 20;
}
console.log(y); // ❌ Error

2️⃣ Hoisted (but initialized as undefined)

When you use var, the declaration is moved to the top of the scope during execution.
Example:
console.log(a); // undefined (not error)
var a = 5;

Behind the scenes:
var a;       // hoisted
console.log(a);
a = 5;

3️⃣ Can be redeclared

This is a big problem and causes bugs:

var a = 1;
var a = 2;   // allowed 😱

console.log(a); // 2


let and const ❌ do not allow redeclaration.

4️⃣ Attaches to the global object (window in browser)
var x = 10;
console.log(window.x); // 10


But let and const do NOT attach to global object.

🧨 Why is var considered bad?

Because it causes weird bugs due to:

Hoisting confusion

Accidental redeclaration

Not block-scoped

Polluting global scope

Harder to maintain

Example bug:

for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
Output:
4, 4, 4


Reason:
var is not block scoped → all callbacks share same i.

💡 Quick Comparison
Feature	  var	              let	         const
Scope	    function	        block	       block
Hoisting	yes (undefined)	  yes (TDZ)	   yes (TDZ)
Redeclare	yes	              no	         no
Reassign	yes	              yes	         no
Adds to window yes	        no	         no


🧠 When to use var?

In modern JavaScript → never recommended
Use let / const.

🎯 One-line definition (Interview Perfect)

var is a function-scoped, hoisted, redeclarable variable that attaches to the global object, which often causes bugs—so modern JS prefers let and const.
