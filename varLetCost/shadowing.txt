Shadowing in JavaScript means:
A variable in an inner scope having the same name as a variable in an outer scope, so the inner one “shadows” (hides) the outer one.

JavaScript will use the nearest variable with that name.
🔹 Simple Example
let a = 10;      // outer variable
function test() {
  let a = 20;    // inner variable (shadows outer 'a')
  console.log(a);
}

test(); // 20
console.log(a); // 10


Inside the function:
The inner a = 20
It shadows the outer a = 10
The outer a becomes temporarily invisible inside the function

🔹 Shadowing with var
var is function-scoped, so shadowing behaves differently:
var x = 5;
if (true) {
  var x = 100;   // SAME variable (not shadowing!)
}
console.log(x); // 100
Here no shadowing happens because both x belong to the same function/global scope.

🔹 Shadowing with let / const (Correct Shadowing)
let x = 5;
if (true) {
  let x = 20;    // shadowing
  console.log(x); // 20
}
console.log(x); // 5

🔹 Illegal Shadowing (Important Interview Question)
let a = 10;
function f() {
  var a = 20; // ❌ illegal shadowing
}
var cannot shadow a let/const in the same scope chain.




But this is OK:

var a = 10;

function f() {
  let a = 20; // ✔️ legal shadowing
}

🔹 Interview-Friendly Definition

Shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (inner scope) has the same name as a variable in an outer scope, making the inner variable override the outer one within that scope.
